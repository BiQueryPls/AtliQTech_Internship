# 🧰 AtliQ Technologies Internship
As a Data Analyst Intern at AtliQ Technologies, I will work with experienced professionals to analyze data, create reports, and provide insights that will aid in making informed business decisions. This internship will be conducted remotely and will provide all the necessary tools and resources to help me succeed in this role.

## WEEK 1: 
> ### Email #1:
> #### HR REPORT
> Sending you these tasks following up on our call.
> The HR dataset can be found in the file [attendance_data.csv](https://github.com/BiQueryPls/AtliQTech_Internship/blob/main/attendance_data.csv). 
> Your tasks are divided into two parts: data cleaning and data analysis.
>
> #### **Task 1: Data Cleaning**
>
> 1. Check for duplicates in the dataset and remove them.
> 2. Standardize the date values to the format YYYY-MM-DD and extract the month name and day type from them.
> 3. Remove any extra characters, such as special characters, from the employee ID values. Some IDs may contain a '@' character at the end, which can be cleaned and brought to a common format.
> 4. Standardize the capitalization of names. Convert all names to title case, which means capitalizing the first letter of each word.  
> 5. Map the corresponding values in the status column with the given abbreviations:
> - Work From Office → WFO
> - Work From Home → WFH
> - Birthday Leave → BL
> - Menstrual Leave → ML

> 2. Calculate the work-from-home (WFH %) percentage in the month of May.
> 3. Determine which day of the week had the highest attendance percentage in the month of June.
> 4. Find out the number of employees who had a WFH percentage greater than 10% in the month of April.
